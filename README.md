[Staffjoy is shutting down](https://blog.staffjoy.com/staffjoy-is-shutting-down-39f7b5d66ef6#.ldsdqb1kp), so we are open-sourcing our code. This version of our V1, intended for on-demand companies and call centers, has been heavily modified so that Staffjoy customers may continue using the software.
